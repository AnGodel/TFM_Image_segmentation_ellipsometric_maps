# Image segmentation in ellipsometric maps

## What are ellipsometric maps

Ellipsometry is an optical method for the characterization of ultrathin films. It is based on the fact that the polarization state of light might change when a light beam is reflected from a surface. If the surface is covered by a thin film (or a stack of films), the entire optical system of film and substrate influences the change in polarization. It is therefore possible to deduce information about the film properties, especially the film thickness.

The basic components of an ellipsometer are: a light source, some optical components like polarizers and retarders and a detector. By controlling the polarization state of the light beam hitting the sample and to analysing the changes in the polarization of the reflected beam, the method obtains the so-called ellipsometric angles: Delta and Psi. They are calculated as a function of the rotation angle of the optical component, the intensity at the detector and the wavelength and angle of incidence of the incoming light. These angles can be then transferred by optical modelling into a number of physical parameters like layer thickness or optical properties. 

By using imaging technology, it is possible to extend the classical ellipsometer to a new form of visualization tool or a microscope with extreme sensitivity to thin films. **Ellipsometric maps** are the result of imaging ellipsometry: images where Delta and Psi have been calculated for each pixel, adding the advantage of spatial resolution to traditional ellipsometry. Secondly, the microscope’s polarization capabilities and its operation at an oblique AOI provide dramatic contrast enhancement for surface structures that only feature marginal differences in their optical properties. For example, monoatomic or monomolecular steps of ultrathin films.

## Motivation of the project

One of the major challenges of ellipsometry, however, is the translation of the ellipsometric parameters Δ and Ψ (i.e. the sample’s ellipsometric fingerprint) to its physical quantities of interest, i.e. a layer thickness or an index of refraction.  Ellipsometry is an indirect technique of surface characterization that uses a numerical model of the sample for calculation of the expected values of Δ and Ψ. The physical sample properties of interest are floating parameters of this model and their final values are estimated by finding the best match of the numerical model and the experimental data. So despite ellipsometric maps can be considered as images in many ways, it is still necessary to extract the numeric value of their pixels in order to transform them into something with more physical meaning.

 A typical ellipsometry measurement will have several data points taken at different wavelengths. The larger the number of points, the more accurately the model can be fitted. So when it comes to ellipsometric maps, it is easy to end up having to handle large sets of maps, which then need to be passed to the model software in order to retrieve the fitted parameter and build one single map with a meaningful parameter in its pixels. Currently Accurion's software has two ways to handle this task:

1. Fitting "point-to-point": in this approach the software creates a vector of delta-psi values for each pixel in the map, creating the delta-psi vs. wavelength curves which are fitted in the model software. This method is the most accurate, but it is also way too slow. For example, for a measurement with 50 wavelengths and maps of 400x300 pixels the software will have to fit 120.000 vectors of 100 elements each, split them in the two curves of 50 elements each, fit the model and retrieve the fitted parameter for that pixel-vector, which can take several hours depending on the size of the maps, the number of wavelengths and the complexity of the model. 
2. Fitting by interpolation: this mode is a very fast mapping mode that may be used for very simple mapping tasks that feature only a single fit parameter. It is based on the idea, that – for some applications – one may translate a single-wavelength Delta or Psi value directly into a physical quantity such as a layer thickness or a refractive index. By definition, the interpolation mode requires exactly one fit parameter in the modeling recipe in order to calculate the one-on-one relation between Delta or Psi and the fit parameter. This mode is suitable only for some application cases, as as mentioned, but also requires some intervention from the user, who has to: find out whether the sample is suitable for this mode or not, and in case yes, which parameter -delta or psi- is going to be used; then select the region of the histogram of that map that the software is going to use to build a look-up table with the calculated values after the fitting.

The two options for fitting complete maps have major drawbacks: the very fast interpolation method is very limited in its application and the very accurate point-to-point method is most often too slow. Currently the only alternative is that the user scrolls through the map stack, selects any region containing structures or objects and crop it, making a faster point-to-point fitting possible as there will be much fewer pixels to fit. This alone is already time consuming and challenging, as the objects can have a differentiated contrast from the background or from other objects only at some wavelengths so at some maps it might be difficult to find interesting objects or sections in one glance. 

**The aim of this project** was to explore the possibilities of clustering algorithms, which are usually applied to images, to automatize the analysis of large sets of maps. The segmentation of ellipsometric maps could be used to:

- help the user to find interesting objects or regions in the maps
- extract the numeric values of the segmented areas, creating the delta-psi vs. wavelength curves automatically 

This way the fitting of segmented maps would be a good balance between the interpolation and point-to-point methods in terms of time required and accuracy of the result, while still being applicable to all kind of samples. It would also reduce the work and attention required from the user and help him in the decision making when it comes to deciding which parts of the map are most interesting for further analysis.
