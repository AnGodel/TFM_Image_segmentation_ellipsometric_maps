# Methods and attributes in the *LambdaVarEllimaps* class 

- self.getdatFile()   

  will find the .ds.dat file in the folder. 
  Instantiates 

  - self.datFile

- self.readdatFile()  

  reads the .dat file using pandas, instantiating:
     - self.datatable: no further use
     - self.WLarray: numpy array with a list of wavelengths used in the measurement
     - self.WLIndices: list of indices of WLarray. Used later for the map index selector
     - self.WLdict: dict with indices as keys and WL as values. For later use as reference in plots
     - self.nWL: just for easy retrieving the number of WL (number of maps) in the measurement
     - self.DeltaFileList: a list of file paths of the delta maps for the measurement. 
     - self.PsiFileList: same, but for psi maps
     - self.AllFileList: a list of file paths alternating delta,psi files. The load function will iterate over them to create a stack of "shuffled" readable images (numpy arrays)

- self.loadAllMaps() 
  - transforms raw delta maps into readable images. Also does some pre-processing, including smoothing and NaN removal by convolution of a 9x9 kernel
  - The NaN removal will fail if there are NaN areas larger than the kernel in the raw map
  - Instantiates:
    - self.AllShuffledStack: the stack of shuffled maps
    - self.AllShuffledStackReshaped: the reshaped stack ready to be passed on to KMeans algorithm
    - self.dim1all, self.dim2all, self.dim3all: dimensions of the stack, being dim3 nWL*2
    - self.AllIndices: a list (np.arange) of all indices in AllShuffledStack. From 0 to dim3all-1
    - self.DeltaIndices: all even indices in self.AllIndices
    - self.PsiIndices: all odd indices in self.AllIndices

# Clusterize method: the key point of the class

- self.clusterize()  
  - Performs segmentation on the stack of maps. Instatiates:
  - self.cluster_list: np.arange(k). List to use to select the C_Selector
  - self.segmented
  - self.segmentedShuffledStack
  - self.cluster_centers_
  - self.cluster_labels_
  - calls self.clustershot()
- self.clustershot() -- extract the coordinates of the pixels of each cluster and the numerical data (delta and psi) from each map along the third axis of self.segmentedShuffledStack. Instantiates:
  - self.firstSegmentedDeltamap -- reference used to identify position of clustered pixels. Any map could be used. First of the stack chosen randomly
  - self.delta_shot -- each row is a list of delta values from one cluster
  - self.psi_shot -- each row is a list of psi values from one cluster
  - self.cluster_coordinates -- list of tuples (Cys, Cxs), each tuple contains the coordinates for one cluster pixels

# Other methods of the class

#### Estimators for the number of clusters and the segmentation processing time

- self.getEstimation()

- self.getEstimation2()

  These are the estimators from yellowbrick library. They return an internal class object called "visualizer", which cannot be directly displayed in streamlit. This could be solved only using a custom library found in GitHub, "streamlit-yellowbrick" from user 'snehankekre' ([link](https://github.com/snehankekre/streamlit-yellowbrick)).

#### Numeric data plotters

- self.plotOneShot(C_Selector)
- self.plotAllShots(C_Selector)
- self.plotBarSegmentedMap(C_Selector, idxSelector)

#### Numeric data collection and export
