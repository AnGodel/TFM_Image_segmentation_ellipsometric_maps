# TFM_Image_segmentation_ellipsometric_maps

Repository containing my project for the master's degree in Data Science from KSchool. 
The project will consist in aplying ML and/or deep learning techniques for edge recognition and image segmentation of ellipsometric micro-maps. This micro-maps are images with particular characteristics, obtained when applying the imaging ellipsometry technique for the analysis of ultra-thin layers of materials. The goal is to facilitate the object and zone detection in a set of micro-maps with varying contrast, so that the user of the ellipsometer can decide which zones should be forwarded to the model-fitting software and optimize the speed of the process.
